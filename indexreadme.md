This is a beautifully designed interactive webpage named **"Love Cards"**. It features a romantic theme that combines aesthetics and user interaction to create a delightful experience.

### Key Features:
1. **Warm and Inviting Design:**
   - The background employs a smooth, pastel-hued gradient with shades of pink and peach (`linear-gradient(to right, #ffafbd, #ffc3a0)`), which aligns perfectly with the romantic tone.
   - The fonts, colors, and layout work harmoniously to evoke warmth and love.

2. **Interactive Flip Cards:**
   - The main attraction is a set of flip cards created with CSS. Each card has:
     - A **front side** displaying a title with an image background and subtle text shadow.
     - A **back side** that reveals a heartfelt message when the user hovers over the card.
   - The **flip animation** is smooth, achieved using CSS transitions and transformations (`transform: rotateY`), giving it a dynamic and modern feel.

3. **Responsive Layout:**
   - The `.card-container` uses `flexbox`, ensuring that the cards are well-aligned and adjust gracefully on devices of varying screen sizes (`flex-wrap: wrap;`).

4. **Thoughtful Details:**
   - Each card has unique messages that evoke emotions, paired with placeholders for images (`background-image: url`). These placeholders could be replaced with personalized images, enhancing the visual appeal.
   - The footer adds a personal touch with a message: "Made with ðŸ’• for someone special."

5. **Accessibility and Simplicity:**
   - The code is clean, adhering to semantic HTML principles. The use of `header`, `main`, and `footer` ensures clarity and accessibility for screen readers.
